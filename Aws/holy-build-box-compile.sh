## This script compiles cross-distribution Linux binaries thanks to
## Holy Build Box: https://github.com/phusion/holy-build-box
##
## The ideal solution would be to use Linux Standard Base
## (LSB). Unfortunately, the LSB C++ compiler is a pre-4.8 gcc that
## does not feature full C++11 capabilities, which prevents compiling
## AWS SDK.
