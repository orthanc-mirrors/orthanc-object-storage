Pending changes in the mainline
===============================


2023-12-20 - v 2.3.1
====================

* AWS plugin:
  * New configuration "EnableAwsSdkLogs" to include AWS SDK logs in Orthanc logs.
* Now displaying size, duration and transfer speed for each read/write operation.

2023-10-17 - v 2.3.0
====================

* AWS plugin:
  * Added a new configuration "UseTransferManager" (false by default).
    When set to true, the Transfer Manager mode is used to upload/download
    whole files to/from the bucket.  If set to false, the default "object"
    mode is used.  The Transfer Manager mode is supposed to be faster,
    especially for large files.
    2 related configurations have been added too:
    - "TransferPoolSize" to define the number of threads to be used by
      the Transfer Manager (default = 10)
    - "TransferBufferSize" to define the size (in MB) 
  * now using the latest AWS SDK C++ (1.11.178).

* in /move-storage: now detecting if file should be moved or not.

2023-07-20 - v 2.2.0
====================

* Azure plugin:
  * now using the latest azure C++ sdk available with vcpkg tag 2023.06.20.

* Google plugin:
  * now using the latest google C++ sdk available with vcpkg tag 2023.06.20.

2022-12-19 - v 2.1.2
====================

* Added a description for all plugins
* Plugins are now disabled if their section is missing in the configuration file.


2022-12-16 - v 2.1.1
====================

* Azure plugin: 
  * fix for Windows build
  * use vcpkg tag 2022.11.14


2022-10-21 - v 2.1.0
====================

* new option "HybridMode" allows selecting where to write new data (FileSystem or ObjectStorage) and reads
  from both storages.  Allowed values: "WriteToFileSystem", "WriteToObjectStorage", "Disabled".
  If disabled (default), the plugin writes all data to the object storage and tries to read them only from the
  object storage.
* new /move-storage route when "HybridMode" is enabled.  This allows moving a study from one-storage to the other
  to, e.g, have recent studies on the file-system and older studies on a cloud object storage.


2022-08-30 - v 2.0.0
====================

* AWS, Google & Azure: BREAKING CHANGE with client-side encryption:
  Fixed reading the master key.  Although the documentation stated that the master key had to be
  encoded in Base64, the master key was interpreted as an Hex string.  All non hex characters were
  ignored and could even end up in a non-deterministic master key (see details in https://groups.google.com/g/orthanc-users/c/FKmq9EuvQkU/m/gbz_bSuwBwAJ).
  The plugin v 2.0.0 won't be able to read data encrypted with v 1.3.3.  You'll have to start a new Orthanc instance
  and transfer all data from old to new Orthanc.
* AWS: added the content MD5 in the request when writing.  This adds integrity check and enables some feature on AWS side
  like https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html


2021-09-06 - v 1.3.3
====================

* Google & Azure:  Added the "EnableLegacyUnknownFiles" configuration option


2021-07-09 - v 1.3.2
====================

* AWS: improved error reporting
* AWS: new option "EnableLegacyUnknownFiles" should be enabled if files were saved with plugin version 1.2.0 and Orthanc 1.9.3.  
  This allows reading .unk files that were generated at this time.  You can get rid of this option once you've renamed all the .unk
  files into .dcm.head files.


2021-07-09 - v 1.3.1
====================

* AWS: Fix reading/deleting DCM header files that were saved with plugin v 1.2.0 and Orthanc 1.9.3 which had a .unk extension.


2021-06-29 - v 1.3.0
====================

* BREAKING CHANGE: fix extension of DCM header files from dcm.head to .dcm.head.  If you have saved compressed or
  encrypted files with a previous version of the plugin and/or with a Orthanc 1.9.1 or 1.9.2, you might have to rename
  all your *.unk files into *.dcm.head files or your *dcm.head files into *.dcm.head files.
* AWS S3:
  - If no access & secret keys are provided, now getting the credentials from the default credentials manager
  - Full static linking is possible
  - Support of dynamic linking against the system-wide Orthanc framework library


2021-04-26 - v 1.2.0
====================

* Added "CreateContainerIfNotExists" configuration option in the Azure plugin
* Support of ReadRange (JSON files are therefore not stored anymore)
* Allow compilation of the AWS S3 plugin without vcpkg
* Added "VirtualAddressing" configuration option in the AWS S3 plugin (for compatibility with minio)


2020-09-07 - v 1.1.0
====================

* Added "RootPath" configuration


2020-09-02 - v 1.0.1
====================

* Internal change: fix compilation to avoid exposing internal symbols which caused a crash at Orthanc startup


2020-09-01 - v 1.0.0
====================

* BREAKING CHANGE: the "StorageEncryption" configuration section is now a subsection of the "AwsS3Storage"
* Azure: now removing spaces and CR at the end of the connectionString since it prevented the plugin to initialize.
* Added "MigrationFromFileSystemEnabled" configuration
* Added "StorageStructure" configuration (flat-legacy)


2020-08-26 - v 0.9.3
====================

* Azure: now removing spaces and CR at the end of the connectionString since it prevented the plugin to initialize.


2020-07-20 - v 0.9.2
====================

* Prevent Orthanc to start if plugin fails to start


2020-07-15 - v 0.9.1
